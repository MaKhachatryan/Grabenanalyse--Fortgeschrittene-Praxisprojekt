## Descriptive plot to get to know data
### Tomb parameter
Clean the data: 
- delete single entries for T46, T56, T62
- create entries for them as 1 tomb but with difference MNIs (as project partner wants)

``` {r tp}
tomb_parameter <- read_excel("Data/raw/Statistics project LMU_tomb parameters_Irene Hoegner_new.xlsx", range = "A2:N12")
combined_tombs <- 
tomb_parameter |> rename(Tomb = 1) |> 
  slice(-c(4, 7, 9, 10)) |>
  

```

The important info in this dataset: "MNI" and "after merging samples from same individual" (**minimum # individuals** vs **actual successful # individual**), since if we don't consider the ratio between them, the result could be bias.

``` {r plot tp}


```
